Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Normal levels are 13.8–17.2 g/dL for men and 12.1–15.1 g/dL for women. Low levels can indicate anemia, blood loss, or bone marrow disorders.

White Blood Cell (WBC) count measures immune cells. Normal range: 4,000–11,000 cells/μL. Elevated levels may indicate infection, inflammation, or leukemia. Low levels may result from bone marrow suppression or viral infections.

Platelet count assesses clotting ability. Normal: 150,000–450,000 per μL. High values suggest clotting disorders or inflammation. Low values may lead to bleeding issues.

Hematocrit (Hct) reflects the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. Normal range: ~40–50% in men, ~35–45% in women. Low hematocrit is associated with anemia.

MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume) describes red blood cell size. Normal: 80–100 fL. High MCV = macrocytic anemia; Low MCV = microcytic anemia.

RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width) indicates variation in RBC size. Normal: 11.5–14.5%. Elevated RDW may indicate nutrient deficiencies.

Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils are WBC subtypes used to detect infections, allergies, and immune conditions.

Reticulocyte count reflects new RBC production. High levels may indicate active blood loss or recovery from anemia.
